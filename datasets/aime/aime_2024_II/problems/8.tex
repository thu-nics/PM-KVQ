Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius 11. When $T$ rests on the inside of $S$, it is internally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
