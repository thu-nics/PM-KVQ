The country of HMMTLand has $8$ cities. Its government decides to construct several two-way roads between pairs of distinct cities. After they finish construction, it turns out that each city can reach exactly $3$ other cities via a single road, and from any pair of distinct cities, either exactly $0$ or $2$ other cities can be reached from both cities by a single road. Compute the number of ways HMMTLand could have constructed the roads.
