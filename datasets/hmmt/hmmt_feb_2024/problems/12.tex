A lame king is a chess piece that can move from a cell to any cell that shares at least one vertex with it, except for the cells in the same column as the current cell.
A lame king is placed in the top-left cell of a $7 \times 7$ grid. Compute the maximum number of cells it can visit without visiting the same cell twice (including its starting cell).
