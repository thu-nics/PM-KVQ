Inside an equilateral triangle of side length $6$, three congruent equilateral triangles of side length $x$ with sides parallel to the original equilateral triangle are arranged so that each has a vertex on a side of the larger triangle, and a vertex on another one of the three equilateral triangles, as shown below.


A smaller equilateral triangle formed between the three congruent equilateral triangles has side length 1. Compute $x$.
