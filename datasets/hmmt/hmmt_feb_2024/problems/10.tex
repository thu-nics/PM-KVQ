A polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is called splitty if and only if for every prime $p$, there exist polynomials $g_{p}, h_{p} \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with $\operatorname{deg} g_{p}, \operatorname{deg} h_{p}<\operatorname{deg} f$ and all coefficients of $f-g_{p} h_{p}$ are divisible by $p$. Compute the sum of all positive integers $n \leq 100$ such that the polynomial $x^{4}+16 x^{2}+n$ is splitty.
