Sally the snail sits on the $3 \times 24$ lattice of points $(i, j)$ for all $1 \leq i \leq 3$ and $1 \leq j \leq 24$. She wants to visit every point in the lattice exactly once. In a move, Sally can move to a point in the lattice exactly one unit away. Given that Sally starts at $(2,1)$, compute the number of possible paths Sally can take.
