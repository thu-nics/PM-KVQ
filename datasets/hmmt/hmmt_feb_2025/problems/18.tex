Albert writes $2025$ numbers $a_{1}, \ldots, a_{2025}$ in a circle on a blackboard. Initially, each of the numbers is uniformly and independently sampled at random from the interval $[0,1]$. Then, each second, he \emph{simultaneously} replaces $a_{i}$ with $\max \left(a_{i-1}, a_{i}, a_{i+1}\right)$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots, 2025$ (where $a_{0}=a_{2025}$ and $a_{2026}=a_{1}$ ). Compute the expected value of the number of distinct values remaining after $100$ seconds.
