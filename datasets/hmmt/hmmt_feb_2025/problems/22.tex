In a two-dimensional cave with a parallel floor and ceiling, two stalactites of lengths $16$ and $36$ hang perpendicularly from the ceiling, while two stalagmites of heights $25$ and $49$ grow perpendicularly from the ground. If the tips of these four structures form the vertices of a square in some order, compute the height of the cave.
