Kevin the frog in on the bottom-left lily pad of a $3 \times 3$ grid of lily pads, and his home is at the topright lily pad. He can only jump between two lily pads which are horizontally or vertically adjacent. Compute the number of ways to remove $4$ of the lily pads so that the bottom-left and top-right lily pads both remain, but Kelvin cannot get home.
