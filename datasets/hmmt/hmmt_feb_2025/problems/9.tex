Let $f$ be the unique polynomial of degree at most $2026$ such that for all $n \in\{1,2,3, \ldots, 2027\}$,
$$
f(n)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } n \text { is a perfect square } \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

Suppose that $\frac{a}{b}$ is the coefficient of $x^{2025}$ in $f$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers such that $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$. Compute the unique integer $r$ between $0$ and $2026$ (inclusive) such that $a-r b$ is divisible by $2027$. (Note that $2027$ is prime.)
