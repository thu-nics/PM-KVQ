Sophie is at $(0,0)$ on a coordinate grid and would like to get to $(3,3)$. If Sophie is at $(x, y)$, in a single step she can move to one of $(x+1, y),(x, y+1),(x-1, y+1)$, or $(x+1, y-1)$. She cannot revisit any points along her path, and neither her $x$-coordinate nor her $y$-coordinate can ever be less than $0$ or greater than 3. Compute the number of ways for Sophie to reach $(3,3)$.
