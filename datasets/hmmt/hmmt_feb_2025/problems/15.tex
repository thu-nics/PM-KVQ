In an $11 \times 11$ grid of cells, each pair of edge-adjacent cells is connected by a door. Karthik wants to walk a path in this grid. He can start in any cell, but he must end in the same cell he started in, and he cannot go through any door more than once (not even in opposite directions). Compute the maximum number of doors he can go through in such a path.
