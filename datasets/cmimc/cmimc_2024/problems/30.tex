Let $\Omega$ be a unit circle with diameter $A B$ and center $O$. Let $C, D$ be on $\Omega$ and lie on the same side of $A B$ such that $\angle C A B=50^{\circ}$ and $\angle D B A=70^{\circ}$. Suppose $A D$ intersects $B C$ at $E$. Let the perpendicular from $O$ to $C D$ intersect the perpendicular from $E$ to $A B$ at $F$. Find the length of OF.
