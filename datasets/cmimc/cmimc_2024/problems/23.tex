Circles $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are inside a rectangle $W X Y Z$ such that $C_{1}$ is tangent to $\overline{W X}, \overline{Z W}$, and $\overline{Y Z} ; C_{2}$ is tangent to $\overline{W X}$ and $\overline{X Y} ;$ and $C_{3}$ is tangent to $\overline{Y Z}, C_{1}$, and $C_{2}$. If the radii of $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are $1, \frac{1}{2}$, and $\frac{2}{3}$ respectively, compute the area of the triangle formed by the centers of $C_{1}$, $C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$.
