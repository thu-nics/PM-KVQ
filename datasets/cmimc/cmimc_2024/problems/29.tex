Quadrilateral $A B C D$ is inscribed in a circle such that the midpoints of its sides also lie on a (different) circle. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{A B}$ and $\overline{C D}$ respectively, and let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from the intersection of $\overline{A C}$ and $\overline{B D}$ onto $\overline{B C}$. If the side lengths of $A B C D$ are $1,3, \sqrt{2}$, and $2 \sqrt{2}$ in some order, compute the greatest possible area of the circumcircle of triangle $M N P$.
