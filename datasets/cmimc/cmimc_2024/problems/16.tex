Michael and James are playing a game where they alternate throwing darts at a simplified dartboard. Each dart throw is worth either $25$ points or $50$ points. They track the sequence of scores per throw (which is shared between them), and on the first time the three most recent scores sum to $125$, the person who threw the last dart wins. On each throw, a given player has a $2 / 3$ chance of getting the score they aim for, and a $1 / 3$ chance of getting the other score. Suppose Michael goes first, and the first two throws are both $25$. If both players use an optimal strategy, what is the probability Michael wins?
