Milo rolls five fair dice which have $4,6,8,12$, and $20$ sides respectively (and each one is labeled $1-n$ for appropriate $n$. How many distinct ways can they roll a full house (three of one number and two of another)? The same numbers appearing on different dice are considered distinct full houses, so $(1,1,1,2,2)$ and $(2,2,1,1,1)$ would both be counted.
