Let $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$ be complex numbers forming a square centered at $0$ in the complex plane with side length $2$. For each $0 \leq k \leq 3$, there are four more complex numbers $z_{4k}, z_{4k+1}, z_{4k+2}$, and $z_{4k+3}$ forming a square centered at $x_{k}$ with side length $\sqrt{2}$. Given that $\prod_{i=0}^{15} z_{i}$ is a positive integer, how many possible values could it take?
