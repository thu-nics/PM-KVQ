Let $\omega$ and $\Omega$ be circles of radius $1$ and $R>1$ respectively that are internally tangent at a point $P$. Two tangent lines to $\omega$ are drawn such that they meet $\Omega$ at only three points $A, B$, and $C$, none of which are equal to $P$. If triangle $A B C$ has side lengths in a ratio of $3: 4: 5$, find the sum of all possible values of $R$.
