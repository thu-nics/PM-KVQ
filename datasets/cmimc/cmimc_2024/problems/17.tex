If $S=\left\{s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n}\right\}$ is a set of integers with $s_{1}<s_{2}<\cdots<s_{n}$, define

$$
f(S)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}(-1)^{k} k^{2} s_{k}
$$
(If $S$ is empty, $f(S)=0$.) Compute the average value of $f(S)$ as $S$ ranges over all subsets of $\left\{1^{2}, 2^{2}, \ldots, 100^{2}\right\}$.
