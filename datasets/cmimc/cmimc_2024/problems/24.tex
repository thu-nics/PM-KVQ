Let $A B C$ be an equilateral triangle with side length $1$. Points $D$ and $E$ lie on $\overline{B C}$ and $\overline{A C}$ respectively such that $\triangle B D E$ is right isosceles, while points $F$ and $G$ lie on $\overline{B C}$ and $\overline{A B}$ respectively such that $\triangle C F G$ is right isosceles. Find the area of the intersection of $\triangle B D E$ and $\triangle C F G$.
