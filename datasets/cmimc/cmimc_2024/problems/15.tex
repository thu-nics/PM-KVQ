In the table below, place the numbers $1-12$ in the shaded cells. You start at the center cell (marked with $*$ ). You repeatedly move up, down, left, or right, chosen uniformly at random each time, until reaching a shaded cell. Your score is the number in the shaded cell that you end up at.

Let $m$ be the least possible expected value of your score (based on how you placed the numbers), and $M$ be the greatest possible expected value of your score. Compute $m \cdot M$.
