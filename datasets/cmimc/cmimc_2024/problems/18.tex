Six assassins, numbered 1-6, stand in a circle. Each assassin is randomly assigned a target such that each assassin has a different target and no assassin is their own target. In increasing numerical order, each assassin, if they are still alive, kills their target. Find the expected number of assassins still alive at the end of this process.
